Description
===========

This is a massive simplification/refactor of the original [jenkins cookbook](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/jenkins)
written by these awesome people:

```ruby
Original Author:: Doug MacEachern (<dougm@vmware.com>)
Contributor:: AJ Christensen <aj@junglist.gen.nz>
Contributor:: Fletcher Nichol <fnichol@nichol.ca>
Contributor:: Roman Kamyk <rkj@go2.pl>
Contributor:: Darko Fabijan <darko@renderedtext.com>
```

I plan on rewriting this README once it's closer to release.
