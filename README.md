[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/opscode-cookbooks/jenkins.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/opscode-cookbooks/jenkins)

Installs and configures Jenkins CI server & node slaves. Resource providers to support automation via jenkins-cli, including job create/update.


Requirements
------------
Chef 0.10.10+ and Ohai 6.10+ for platform_family use.

### Platform:
#### Server (Master) Recipe

* Ubuntu
* RHEL/CentOS

Attributes
----------
### Common Attributes

* `node['jenkins']['mirror']` - Base URL for downloading all code (WAR file and plugins).
* `node['jenkins']['java_home']` - Java install path, used for for cli commands.
* `node['jenkins']['iptables_allow']` - If iptables is enabled, add a rule passing `node['jenkins']['server']['port']`.

### Master/Server related Attributes

* `node['jenkins']['server']['install_method']` - Whether Jenkins is installed from packages or run from a WAR file.
* `node['jenkins']['server']['home']` - Location of `JENKINS_HOME` directory.
* `node['jenkins']['server']['user']` - User the Jenkins server runs as.
* `node['jenkins']['server']['group']` - Jenkins user primary group.
* `node['jenkins']['server']['port']` - TCP port Jenkins server listens on.
* `node['jenkins']['server']['url']` - Base URL of the Jenkins server.
* `node['jenkins']['server']['plugins']` - Download the latest version of plugins in this Array, bypassing update center. The members of the Array can either be strings if the latest version desired OR a Hash of the form
`{'name' => 'git', 'version' => '1.4.0'}` if a specific version is required.
* `node['jenkins']['server']['jvm_options']` - Additional tuning parameters to pass the underlying JVM process.
* `node['jenkins']['http_proxy']['variant']` - use `nginx` or `apache2` to proxy traffic to jenkins backend (`nginx` by default)
* `node['jenkins']['http_proxy']['www_redirect']` - add a redirect rule for 'www.*' URL requests ("disable" by default)
* `node['jenkins']['http_proxy']['listen_ports']` - list of HTTP ports for the HTTP proxy to listen on ([80] by default).
* `node['jenkins']['http_proxy']['host_name']` - primary vhost name for the HTTP proxy to respond to (`node['fqdn']` by default).
* `node['jenkins']['http_proxy']['host_aliases']` - optional list of other host aliases to respond to (empty by default).
* `node['jenkins']['http_proxy']['client_max_body_size']` - max client upload size ("1024m" by default, nginx only).
* `node['jenkins']['http_proxy']['server_auth_method']` - Authentication with the server can be done with cas (using `apache2::mod_auth_cas`), or basic (using `htpasswd`). The default is no authentication.
* `node['jenkins']['http_proxy']['basic_auth_username']` - Username to use for HTTP Basic Authentication.
* `node['jenkins']['http_proxy']['basic_auth_password']` - Password to use with HTTP Basic Authentication.
* `node['jenkins']['http_proxy']['cas_login_url']` - Login url for cas if using cas authentication.
* `node['jenkins']['http_proxy']['cas_validate_url']` - Validation url for cas if using cas authentication.
* `node['jenkins']['http_proxy']['cas_validate_server']` - Whether to validate the server cert. Defaults to off.
* `node['jenkins']['http_proxy']['cas_root_proxy_url']` - If set, sets the url that the cas server redirects to after auth.
* `node['jenkins']['http_proxy']['ssl']['enabled']` - Configures jenkins to use SSL. This cookbook expects you to provide your own certificates. You can tell Jenkins where your certificates with the below attributes.
* `node['jenkins']['http_proxy']['ssl']['cert_path']` - The path to your SSL certificate.
* `node['jenkins']['http_proxy']['ssl']['key_path']` - The path to your SSL key.
* `node['jenkins']['http_proxy']['ssl']['ca_cert_path']` - If set, configures apache to use an intermediate certificate authority. Nginx does not use this attribute and expects any intermediate certificates to be appended in the same file as your SSL certificate.

Recipes
-------
### server
Creates all required directories, installs Jenkins and generates an ssh private key and stores the ssh public key in the `node['jenkins']['server']['pubkey']` attribute for use by the node recipes. The installation method is controlled by the `node['jenkins']['server']['install_method']` attribute. The following install methods are supported:

* __package__ - Installs Jenkins from the official jenkins-ci.org packages.
* __war__ - Downloads the latest version of the Jenkins WAR file from http://jenkins-ci. The server process is configured to run as a runit service.

### proxy
Installs a proxy and creates a vhost to route traffic to the installed Jenkins server. The type of HTTP proxy that is installed and configured is determined by the `node['jenkins']['http_proxy']['variant']` attribute. The following HTTP proxy variants are supported:

* __apache2__
* __nginx__


Resource/Provider
-----------------
### jenkins_command
This resource executes arbitrary commands against the [Jenkins CLI](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CLI), supporting the following actions:

    :execute

Here's an [example list of Jenkins commands](https://gist.github.com/sethvargo/7814182), although these can change with major version releases. For example, to perform a Jenkins safe restart:

```ruby
jenkins_command 'safe-restart'
```

To reload the configuration from disk:

```ruby
jenkins_command 'reload-configuration'
```

To prevent Jenkins from starting any new builds (in preparation for a shutdown):

```ruby
jenkins_command 'quiet-down'
```

**NOTE** You must add your own `not_if`/`only_if` guards to the `jenkins_command` to prevent duplicate commands from executing. Just like Chef's core `execute` resource, the `jenkins_command` resource has no way of being idempotent.

### jenkins_credentials
This resource manages Jenkins credentials, supporting the following actions:

    :create, :delete

The following type of credentials are supported:

* __Password__ - Basic username + password credentials.
* __Private Key__ - Credentials that use a username + private key (optionally protected with a passphrase).

The `jenkins_credentials` resource is actually the base resource for several resources that map directly back to a credentials type:

* `jenkins_password_credentials`
* `jenkins_private_key_credentials`

This uses the Jenkins Groovy API to create/delete credentials. It also supports whyrun mode.

The `:create` action idempotently creates a set of Jenkins credentials on the current node. The `username` attribute (also the name attribute) corresponds to the username of the credentials on the target node. You may also specify a `description` which is useful in credential identification.

```ruby
# Create password credentials
jenkins_credentials 'weaksauce' do
  description 'passwords are for suckers'
  password 'superseekret'
end

# Create private key credentials
jenkins_private_key_credentials 'neckbeard' do
  description 'this is more like it'
  private_key "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEpAIBAAKCAQ..."
end

# Private keys with a passphrase will also work
jenkins_private_key_credentials 'super_neckbeard' do
  description 'can haz passphrase'
  private_key "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEpAIBAAKCAQ..."
  passphrase 'secret'
end
```

The `:delete` action idempotently removes a set of Jenkins credentials from the system. You can use the base `jenkins_credentials` resource or any of it's children to perform the deletion.

```ruby
jenkins_credentials 'weaksauce' do
  action :delete
end

jenkins_private_key_credentials 'neckbeard' do
  action :delete
end
```

**NOTE** Credentials in Jenkins can be created with 2 different "scopes" which determines where the credentials can be used:

* __GLOBAL__ - This credential is available to the object on which the credential is associated and all objects that are children of that object. Typically you would use global-scoped credentials for things that are needed by jobs.
* __SYSTEM__ - This credential is only available to the object on which the credential is associated. Typically you would use system-scoped credentials for things like email auth, slave connection, etc, i.e. where the Jenkins instance itself is using the credential. Unlike the global scope, this significantly restricts where the credential can be used, thereby providing a higher degree of confidentiality to the credential.

The credentials created with the `jenkins_credentials` are assigned a `GLOBAL` scope.

### jenkins_job
This resource manages Jenkins jobs, supporting the following actions:

    :create, :delete, :disable, :enable

The resource is fully idempotent and convergent. It also supports whyrun mode.

The `:create` action requires a Jenkins job `config.xml`. This config file must exist on the target node and contain a valid Jenkins job configuration file. Because the Jenkins CLI actually reads and generates it's own copy of this file, **do NOT** write this configuration inside of the Jenkins job. We recommend putting them in a temporary directory:

```ruby
xml = File.join(Chef::Config[:file_cache_path], 'bacon-config.xml')

# You could also use a `cookbook_file` or pure `file` resource to generate
# content at this path.
template xml do
  source 'custom-config.xml.erb'
end

# Create a jenkins job (default action is `:create`)
jenkins_job 'bacon' do
  config xml
end
```

```ruby
jenkins_job 'bacon' do
  action :delete
end
```

You can disable a Jenkins job by specifying the `:disable` option. This will disable an existing job, if and only if that job exists and is enabled. If the job does not exist, an exception is raised.

```ruby
jenkins_job 'bacon' do
  action :disable
end
```

You can enable a Jenkins job by specifying the `:enable` option. This will enable an existing job, if and only if that job exists and is disabled. If the job does not exist, an exception is raised.

```ruby
jenkins_job 'bacon' do
  action :enable
end
```

### jenkins_plugin
This resource manages Jenkins plugins, supporting the following actions:

    :install, :uninstall, :enable, :disable

This uses the Jenkins CLI to install plugins. By default, it does a cold deploy, meaning the plugin is installed while Jenkins is still running. **This LWRP does not install plugin dependencies - you must specify all plugin dependencies or Jenkins may not startup correctly!**

The `:install` action idempotely installs a Jenkins plugin on the current node. The name attribute corresponds to the name of the plugin on the Jenkins Update Center. You can also specify a particular version of the plugin to install. Finally, you can specify a full source URL or local path (on the node) to a plugin.

```ruby
# Install the latest version of the greenballs plugin
jenkins_plugin 'greenballs'

# Install version 1.3 of the greenballs plugin
jenkins_plugin 'greenballs' do
  version '1.3'
end

# Install a plugin from a given hpi (or jpi)
jenkins_plugin 'greenballs' do
  source 'http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/plugins/greenballs/1.10/greenballs.hpi'
end
```

The `:uninstall` action removes (uninstalls) a Jenkins plugin idempotently on the current node.

```ruby
jenkins_plugin 'greenballs' do
  action :uninstall
end
```

The `:enable` action enables a plugin. If the plugin is not installed, an exception is raised. If the plugin is already enabled, no action is taken.

```ruby
jenkins_plugin 'greenballs' do
  action :enable
end
```

The `:disable` action disables a plugin. If the plugin is not installed, an exception is raised. If the plugin is already disabled, no action is taken.

```ruby
jenkins_plugin 'greenballs' do
  action :disable
end
```

**NOTE** You may need to restart the Jenkins server after changing a plugin. Because this varies on a case-by-case basis (and because everyone chooses to manage their Jenkins servers differently) this LWRP does **NOT** restart Jenkins for you.

### jenkins_slave
This resource manages Jenkins slaves, supporting the following actions:

    :create, :delete, :connect, :disconnect, :online, :offline

The following slave launch methods are supported:

* __JNLP/Java Web Start__ - Starts a slave by launching an agent program through JNLP. The launch in this case is initiated by the slave, thus slaves need not be IP reachable from the master (e.g. behind the firewall). This launch method is supported on *nix and Windows platforms.
* __SSH__ - Jenkins has a built-in SSH client implementation that it can use to talk to remote `sshd` daemon and start a slave agent. This is the most convenient and preferred method for Unix slaves, which normally has `sshd` out-of-the-box.

The `jenkins_slave` resource is actually the base resource for several resources that map directly back to a launch method:

* `jenkins_jnlp_slave`
* `jenkins_ssh_slave`

The `:create` action idempotely creates a Jenkins slave on the master. The name attribute corresponds to the name of the slave (which is also used to uniquely identify the slave).

```ruby
# Create a basic JNLP slave
jenkins_jnlp_slave 'grimlock' do
  description 'full of cesium salami'
  remote_fs '/home/jenkins'
  labels ['transformer', 'autobot', 'dinobot']
end

# Create a slave launched via SSH
jenkins_ssh_slave 'starscream' do
  description 'should be the leader'
  remote_fs '/home/starscream'
  labels ['transformer', 'decepticon', 'seeker']
  # SSH specific attributes
  host 'localhost'
  username 'starscream'
end

# A slave's executors, usage mode and availability can also be configured
jenkins_jnlp_slave 'soundwave' do
  description 'casettes are still cool'
  remote_fs '/home/jenkins'
  executors 5
  usage_mode 'exclusive'
  availability 'demand'
  in_demand_delay 1
  idle_delay 3
  labels ['transformer', 'decepticon', 'badass']
end

# Create a slave with a full environment
jenkins_jnlp_slave 'shrapnel' do
  description 'bugs are cool'
  remote_fs '/home/jenkins'
  labels ['transformer', 'decepticon', 'insecticon']
  environment(
    FOO: 'bar',
    BAZ: 'qux'
  )
end

# Windows JNLP slave
jenkins_jnlp_slave 'windoze' do
  remote_fs 'C:\jenkins'
  user 'Administrator'
  labels ['transformer', 'autobot', 'dinobot']
end
```

The `:delete` action idempotently removes a slave from the cluster. Any services used to manage the underlying slave process will also be disabled.

```ruby
jenkins_jnlp_slave 'grimlock' do
  action :delete
end

jenkins_ssh_slave 'starscream' do
  action :delete
end
```

The `:connect` action idempotently forces the master to reconnect to the specified slave. You can use the base `jenkins_slave` resource or any of it's children to perform the connection.

```ruby
jenkins_slave 'grimlock' do
  action :connect
end

jenkins_ssh_slave 'starscream' do
  action :connect
end
```

The `:disconnect` action idempotently forces the master to disconnect the specified slave. You can use the base `jenkins_slave` resource or any of it's children to perform the connection.

```ruby
jenkins_slave 'grimlock' do
  action :disconnect
end

jenkins_ssh_slave 'starscream' do
  action :disconnect
end
```

The `:online` action idempotently brings a slave back online. You can use the base `jenkins_slave` resource or any of it's children to bring the slave online.

```ruby
jenkins_slave 'grimlock' do
  action :online
end

jenkins_ssh_slave 'starscream' do
  action :online
end
```

The `:offline` action idempotently takes a slave temporarily offline. An optional reason for going offline can be provided with the `offline_reason` attribute. You can use the base `jenkins_slave` resource or any of it's children to take a slave offline.

```ruby
jenkins_slave 'grimlock' do
  action :offline
end

jenkins_ssh_slave 'starscream' do
  offline_reason 'ran out of energon'
  action :offline
end
```

**NOTE** It's worth noting the somewhat confusing differences between _disconnecting_ and _off-lining_ a slave:

* __Disconnect__ - Instantly closes the channel of communication between the master and slave. Currently executing jobs will be terminated immediately. If a slave is configured with an availability of `always` the master will attempt to reconnect to the slave.
* __Offline__ - Keeps the channel of communication between the master and slave open. Currently executing jobs will be allowed to finish, but no new jobs will be scheduled on the slave.

### jenkins_user
This resource manages Jenkins users, supporting the following actions:

    :create, :delete

This uses the Jenkins groovy API to create users.

The `:create` action idempotently creates a Jenkins user on the current node. The id attribute corresponds to the username of the id of the user on the target node. You may also specify a name, email, and list of SSH keys.

```ruby
# Create a Jenkins user
jenkins_user 'grumpy'

# Create a Jenkins user with specific attributes
jenkins_user 'grumpy' do
  full_name    'Grumpy Dwarf'
  email        'grumpy@example.com'
  public_keys  ['ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1y...']
end
```

The `:delete` action removes a Jenkins user from the system.

```ruby
jenkins_user 'grumpy' do
  action :delete
end
```


Caveats
-------
### Authentication
If you use or plan to use authentication for your Jenkins cluster (which we highly recommend), you will need to set a special node attribute:

```ruby
node['jenkins']['cli']['private_key']
```

The underlying executor class (which all LWRPs use) intelligently adds authentication information to the Jenkins CLI commands if this attribute is set. The method used to generate and populate this private key is left to the user:

```ruby
# Using search
master = search(:node, 'fqdn:master.ci.example.com').first
node.set['jenkins']['cli']['private_key'] = master['jenkins']['private_key']

# Using encrypted data bags and chef-sugar
private_key = encrypted_data_bag_item('jenkins', 'keys')['private_key']
node.set['jenkins']['cli']['private_key'] = private_key
```


### Proxies
If you need to pass through a proxy server to communicate between your masters and slaves, you will need to set a special node attribute:

```ruby
node['jenkins']['cli']['proxy']
```

The underlying executor class (which all LWRPs use) intelligently passes proxy information to the Jenkins CLI commands if this attribute is set. It should be set in the form `HOST:PORT`:

```ruby
node.set['jenkins']['cli']['proxy'] = '1.2.3.4:5678'
```
