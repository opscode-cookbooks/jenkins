# This is a very basic recipe for installing Java on the target system. It is
# NOT included in any recipes by default. The purpose of this cookbook is to
# install Jenkins, not manage a Java. For complex Java scenarios, you should
# use the Java community cookbook or construct your own.
#
# Do NOT submit patches adding support for additional platforms
# Do NOT submit patches adding support for installing Java derivatives
# Do NOT submit patches adding support for installing different Java versions
#
# This recipe is not included by default, and you have no obligation to use it.
# We are going to be incredibly opinionated about what this recipe includes, as
# it is a minimum viable cookbook for installing Java. If you need a more
# complex scenario, that is outside the scope of this cookbook.
